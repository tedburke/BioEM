Academic Markdown and Citations

25-Oct-2024: I'm currently using ieee.csl for the citation style. However, I added ieee-with-url.csl to the github repo too, in case that turns out to be a better option. I'm not sure what the difference is exactly, but I expect there will be several URL references, so if those don't work well with ieee.csl, then that may settle it.
